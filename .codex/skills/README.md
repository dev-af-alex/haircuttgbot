# Local Skills

This directory contains Codex skills for this repository.

## Layout

- `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` is required.
- Optional subfolders:
  - `scripts/` for executable helpers
  - `references/` for focused supporting docs
  - `assets/` for reusable templates/snippets

## Quick Start

1. Copy `.codex/skills/_template` to a new folder.
2. Rename the folder to your skill name (for example, `review.api`).
3. Edit `SKILL.md` with the workflow and expected inputs/outputs.
