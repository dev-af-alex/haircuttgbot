# Definition of Done (DoD)

A task is DONE when:

- Change is implemented and reviewed
- Tests exist (or a documented reason why not)
- Documentation is updated (or a documented reason why not)
- The project still runs locally via docker-compose (`docs/04-delivery/local-dev.md`)
- Security gates remain wired (SAST/dep/secrets)
- No secrets/PII are added to the repo
