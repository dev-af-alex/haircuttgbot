# Open questions (must trend to zero)

## High priority (blocks planning / stack selection)

- None at the moment.

## Medium priority (blocks implementation details)

- None at the moment.

## Low priority (can be decided later)

- Q3: Do we need waitlist behavior when slot is unavailable?
- Q4: Should clients receive reminder notifications before appointment time (if yes, how long before)?
- Q5: Do we need export/reporting of schedule and bookings (CSV, monthly summary)?

Process:

- When a question is answered, move the answer into the proper SSOT document and delete the question.
