# Privacy NFR

## 1) Data minimization

- Only collect: Telegram identifiers needed for role mapping and notifications, booking metadata, schedule blocks, cancellation reasons.
- Avoid collecting: unnecessary profile data, payment data, and free-text personal notes not required for scheduling.

## 2) User rights (if applicable)

- Export: TODO (whether user can request booking history export).
- Deletion: TODO (account/booking deletion policy and allowed exceptions).
- Consent: TODO (if jurisdiction requires explicit notice/consent for personal data handling).

## 3) Retention

- Retention policy: TODO (booking and audit retention period by role/legal needs).
- Deletion policy: TODO (soft/hard delete rules and anonymization approach).
